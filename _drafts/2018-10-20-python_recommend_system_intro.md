Surprise的名称是简单Python推荐系统引擎（Simple Python Recommendation System Engine）的缩写，属于Scikit的一个算法包，用于构建推荐引擎。

Surprise的目的是：

- 为用户提供实验的完美控制。
- 减轻数据处理的痛苦
- 

Give users perfect control over their experiments. To this end, a strong emphasis is laid on documentation, which we have tried to make as clear and precise as possible by pointing out every detail of the algorithms.
Alleviate the pain of Dataset handling. Users can use both built-in datasets (Movielens, Jester), and their own custom datasets.
Provide various ready-to-use prediction algorithms such as baseline algorithms, neighborhood methods, matrix factorization-based ( SVD, PMF, SVD++, NMF), and many others. Also, various similarity measures (cosine, MSD, pearson…) are built-in.
Make it easy to implement new algorithm ideas.
Provide tools to evaluate, analyse and compare the algorithms performance. Cross-validation procedures can be run very easily using powerful CV iterators (inspired by scikit-learn excellent tools), as well as exhaustive search over a set of parameters.
